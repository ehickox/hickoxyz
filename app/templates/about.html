<h2 class="margined">about</h2>
<p class="margined">
  My name is Eli Hickox. I'm a software engineer based in The San Francisco Bay Area.
  I spent three years studying Mathematics and Computer Science at The University of
  Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, but then I dropped out to work on the Systems team
  at RelateIQ, a Salesforce company.
</p>
<p class="margined">
  Since then, RelateIQ has become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SalesforceIQ">SalesforceIQ</a>, and SalesforceIQ has been rebranded as Einstein. I spent three years there working as a back-end engineer on all parts of the system
  from the Salesforce integration for <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/sales-cloud/features/crm-email-connector/">Salesforce Inbox</a> to 
  <a href="https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/spring17/release-notes/rn_sales_einstein_automatic_activity_capture.htm">Automated Activity Capture</a> for Salescloud.
  Some examples of projects I have brought to life are: geolocation for read receipts, the mobile news feed, and custom object support for Salesforce Inbox.
  During my final year at Salesforce, I worked on their world-class Networking and Security team, where I learned about AWS, Terraform, Chef, and other technologies. 
  I built a 'Terraform as a Service' application prototype to integrate the disparate infrastructures of Salesforce's acquired startups. I deployed and maintained a PGP keyserver
  to facilitate PGP commit signing.
</p>
<p class="margined">
  After that, I spent year as a back-end engineer at <a href="https://split.io">Split Software</a>, working on things such as 
  <a href="https://www.split.io/blog/split-workspaces-managing-experiments-and-feature-flags-across-teams-and-projects-at-scale/">workspaces</a>
  and the event ingestion pipeline. I was instrumental in developing the <a href="https://www.split.io/blog/introducing-feature-monitoring/">Alerting and Monitoring</a> feature.
</p>
<p class="margined">
  Following my time at Split, I spent nearly a year as a a full-stack engineer at <a href="https://www.lyric.com">Lyric Hospitality</a>, helping to build the future of short-term rentals. 
  Unfortunately my time there was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as people stopped making rentals.
  During my time there, I was instrumental in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_distribution_system">GDS</a> integration, affiliate tracking with <a href="https://www.kayak.com/">KAYAK.com</a>, and most importantly, 
  I implemented a reservation defragmentation system that increased unit availability by 8% on average across all inventory. I used a library called <a href="https://www.optaplanner.org/">Optaplanner</a>.
  I built the service from the ground up, writing everything from the Terraform to deploy the service, to the actual Java code which calculated the optimal solutions.
</p>
<p class="margined">
  My next position was at <a href="https://eaze.com">Eaze</a> for over two years. I joined during the height of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic when the cannabis delivery business was booming. 
  I was brought on as a backend engineer primarily to build out the API Gateway server for a new React-Native Driver mobile app.
  From there, I branched out to work on all parts of the system. I was particuarly instrumental in developing the <a href="https://www.metrc.com/">METRC</a> 
  compliance mechanisms necessary for the expansion of Eaze into Michigan. My final position at Eaze was that of Data Engineer. I was brought into the Analytics team 
  to modernize their Python infrastructure and to help facilitate best practices. 
</p>
<p class="margined">
  Following my time at Eaze, I was a Senior Data Engineer on the Data Cloud team at <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/">Chainalysis</a> for nearly three years. 
  I worked on the next-generation real-time blockchain ingestion system based on Databricks' Delta Live Tables (DLT) platform, implementing a massive-scale streaming join architecture capable of handling chains with billions of transactions at low latency.
  I often collaborated directly with Databricks Solutions Architects, using undocumented beta features to push performance limits.
  I also maintained infrastructure for the Investigations API, a critical product used by agencies such as the IRS and FBI, and spearheaded the design of a beta pre-production environment to improve operational efficiency and compliance.
</p>
<p class="margined">
  I'm currently a founding engineer at <a href="https://anysoft.app">AnySoft</a>, where we're building the future of enterprise software. 
  I serve as the sole infrastructure engineer, responsible for our multi-tenant Kubernetes architecture and cloud compliance efforts (SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001). 
  Many on the small team are RelateIQ → Salesforce veterans, and I'm effectively the one-person infra team. I also contribute to application code as needed. 
  My focus is on enabling the team to scale and innovate safely, automating what would otherwise require dozens of engineers.
